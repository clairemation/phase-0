- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Feels good. There's more room for creativity, experimentation, an playing around. Plus you get to figure out how to implement stuff (and there may be more than one way), whereas the HTML exercises at CodeAcademy pretty much walked you through everything.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

There are plenty of resources online for HTML5, so it isn't hard to find answers to just about anything you might want to know. But I do find the document outline somewhat challenging to grasp. I never knew that header tags actually affect how the browser understands the structure of the document. It seems like you could easily end up with unintended results. I guess that underscores how you shouldn't use semantic tags for stylistic purposes.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Technically we didn't use formatting. But we did use a table, which feels a bit like defeat.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML seems pretty limited, being only a markup language. That's the bad. But now that we also have CSS and JavaScript and PHP and whatever else, that limitation seems like the flip side of a benefit. Keeping semantics and style totally separate is a challenge, and having each task relegated to a different system helps compartmentalize them.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I'm already familiar with HTML, so I know the basic tags pretty much by heart. But I'm also frequently looking up ones I don't know, and even ones I do know that I want to know more about. I guess I don't have any memorization tricks, but I find that the process of searching something out on my own tends to cement it in my head better than studying from a list.
