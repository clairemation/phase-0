<!-- Add your reflection here
-What did you learn about the DOM?
I learned about the template tag, though I still don't really understand how it works, or how a template element doesn't display but it's clone does when apprended to the document body.

-What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
My new favorite methods are querySelector and querySelectorAll, which select an item by using a CSS selector. This is great because in JavaScript if you wanted to select the first X element of Y class inside Z object that didn't have an ID of Whatever, this would take a bunch of steps. Whereas you can do that easily in one line of CSS: z x.y:first-child:not(id:Whatever).
