###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a new repository is easy.
####Start at your GitHub **profile page**.
Your GitHub profile page is located at `github.com/your-user-name`. (Replace `your-user-name` with your own user name.)

####Click **New repository**.
Are you on your profile page? Across the top is a light gray bar. On the far right of this you'll see three little icons in a row: a bell, a plus sign, and a tiny version of your avatar image. **Click the plus sign.** A box will pop up with two options. Click on the first one: **New repository**.

Now to...
####Fill in the details.
Clicking **New repository** will bring you to a new page titled "Create a new repository." There are several options to set.
**Owner** should already be you.
**Repository name, Description** and **Public** or **Private** -- Set these any way you like. Just don't use spaces in the name.
**Initialize this repository with a README** --Make sure this box is checked.
**Add .gitignore** should be set to **none**.
**Add a license** -- The license is a copyright form that enumerates what other people are allowed to do with your work. If you're not sure about this, you can just choose **MIT License** for now.

Finally...
####Click **Create repository**.
And there's your new repository!

Now you want to clone your new repository to your local computer.

####**Go to the folder** where you want to put the repository.
In your terminal, navigate to the folder using the `cd` command.

####Get your repository's clone URL.
Back in your browser, look to the lower-right part of the repository page for the clone URL. Click the clipboard icon to copy it.

####Clone the repository to your computer.
Back to the terminal. Type `git clone ` and then paste the URL you just copied, so it looks like this: `git clone your-clone-url`, but with your own URL in place of `your-clone-url`. Press enter.

Ta-dah! Git spits out some text and creates an identical clone of your GitHub repository!

•Assess the importance of using licenses.


•What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?


•Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
